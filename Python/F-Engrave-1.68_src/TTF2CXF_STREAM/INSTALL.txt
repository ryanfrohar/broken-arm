1.)  At a Linux command prompt type "make install" to create the ttf2cxf_stream executable.
The dependancies for ttf2cxf_stream may require that the following command be performed first:
	

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install g++

sudo apt-get install libfreetype6-dev 
(Note: if you are using a non-Debian based Linux distribution the installation commands may vary)




2.)  When F-Engrave is executed it will look for the "ttf2cxf_stream" executable. if it is found and working f-engrave will use it to read True Type font (TTF) files in the font directory.

  
F-Engrave will function properly without the ttf2cxf executable but it will not show or read .ttf font files.
