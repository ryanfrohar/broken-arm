			Commons Lang Package
			   Version 1.0.1
			    Release Notes


INTRODUCTION:

This document contains the release notes for this version of the Commons
Lang package. Commons Lang is a set of utility functions and reusable 
components that should be a help in any Java environment.

NEW FEATURES:

This release is a bugfix release for the Lang 1.0 release. There are no new features.

BUG FIXES:

#14062:     StringUtils.split fails to handle (String, null, int) correctly.
            This results in the String "null" appearing in the split text, when 
            the text is not entirely consumed in the split, ie) int is less 
            than the number of whitespace tokens in the String.
            Fix is courtesy of Mark McDowell.

#-    :     SystemUtils.isJavaVersionAtLeast made static.

#-    :     NumberUtils test fails in JDK 1.2 due to lack of 1.2 support for 
            "1.1E-700F". Fix is to use SystemUtils to protect it for the moment.

#-    :     ToStringStyle did not compile under JDK 1.2 due to inner class 
            issues. Added explicit 'this.' prefixes to make this so.

#14566:     NumberRange.getMaximum was returning the minimum.
            Bug reported by Kasper Ronning.

#13527:     ExceptionUtils now handles getCausedByException and getRootCause 
            from EJBException and ServletException, as reported by Lars Beuster.

#14334:     NestableDelegate now implements Serializable, as reported by 
            Max Rydahl Andersen.

#13568:     Enums cannot now be created with the same name as an already 
            existing Enum. Enum now compiles under JDK 1.2.

DEPRECATIONS:

Solely a bugfix version.
